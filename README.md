**TikTok** videos receive numerous user reports for many reasons. Not all reported videos can undergo review by a human moderator. Videos that make claims (as opposed to opinions) are much more likely to contain content that violates the platformâ€™s terms of service. TikTok seeks a way to identify videos that make claims, to prioritize them for review. The data team built two tree-based classification models. Both models were used to predict on a hold-out validation dataset, and the final model selection was determined by the model with the best recall score. The final model was then used to score a test dataset to estimate future performance. In this scenario, we were tasked to create a machine learning model for the claims classification data. We also used some useful and advanced methodologies; such as "Tokenization" to convert a sequence of text data into smaller parts which was a predictive feature, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
